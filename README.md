# Find Donors for CharityML (Supervised Learning)

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply supervised learning techniques and help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause. Below are the steps, which is documented in [finding_donors.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Find-Donors-for-CharityML/blob/master/finding_donors.ipynb).

- Explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded
- Apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format
- Evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution
- Optimize the model selected and present it as your solution to CharityML
- Explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Project Highlights

This project involves many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and also a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Below are the key skills required for the project:

- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Data

The [modified census dataset](https://github.com/iDataist/Find-Donors-for-CharityML/blob/master/census.csv) consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. This paper can be found [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
